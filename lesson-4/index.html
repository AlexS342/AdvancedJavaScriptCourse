            Waiter: 'Welcome to our restaurant. Did you book a table in advance?'<br>
            David: 'Hello. Yes, we ordered a table for Laurins.'<br>
            Waiter: 'All right. Follow me. Here's your table, as you wanted, by the window. Let me take your and your
            lady's coats.'<br>
            David: 'Yes, please. Sit down, dear.'<br>
            Waiter: 'Check out our menu. I'll come in a minute ... Are you ready to order?'<br>
            David: 'No, not yet. Give us a little time to study the menu.'<br>
            Waiter: 'Good. Call me when you're ready.'<br>
            David: 'Darling, what will you eat?'<br>
            Amanda: 'Oh, there is such a chic choice of dishes. I am even confused. What would you advise?'<br>
            David: 'I can recommend fried duck with cream sauce. A tasty dish. The fish here is also gorgeous. Actually,
            the chef in this restaurant is a true master. All his dishes are delicious.'<br>
            Amanda: 'Then I'll order a salad with seafood and a duck.'<br>
            David: 'And the dessert?'<br>
            Amanda: 'I would like to try a cheesecake. I love to cook it myself, but I will not refuse from the ready
            dish.'<br>
            Amanda: 'Excellent. Waiter!'<br>
            Waiter: 'I'm listening to you.'<br>
            David: 'Bring us, please, a salad with seafood and a duck for the lady, and I'll order a julien with
            mushrooms and entrecote.'<br>
            Waiter: 'Will you order the dessert?'<br>
            David: 'Yes, of course. One cheesecake and a slice of banana cake.'<br>
            Waiter: 'What will you drink?'<br>
            David: 'Today we have a holiday, an anniversary, which means that we will drink champagne.'<br>
            Waiter: 'Dry, sweet or semisweet?'<br>
            David: 'White semisweet.'<br>
            Waiter: 'Excellent choice. Your order will be ready in 15 minutes. Shall I bring the champagne right
            now?'<br>
            David: 'Yes, so it will not be boring to wait for our order.'<br>
            Waiter: 'Here is your champagne. And this is a gift from the chef in honor of your holiday.'<br>
            David: 'Thank you very much. We are very pleased!'<br>
            Amanda: 'Your order, sir. Anything else?'<br>
            David: 'Thank you. All is perfect.'<br>
